A Thermopneumatic Processing Plant uses pressure and [link{menu/heat}]heat [link{}] to process materials. It has a few uses.

[prefix{l}]Creating Plastic[prefix{}]
It can take LPG (100mB) and Coal (1) to create Liquid Plastic (1000mB). This Liquid Plastic can then be converted into its solid state using a [link{block/plasticMixer}]Plastic Mixer[link{}]. To do this no pressure is required, just heat.

[prefix{l}]Cracking heavier fuels into lighter fuels[prefix{}]
The Thermopneumatic Processing Plant can be used to crack heavier fuels produced by a [link{block/refinery}]Refinery [link{}] into lighter ones at an 80% efficiency. This means:

Diesel --> Kerosene
Kerosene --> Gasoline
Gasoline --> LPG
