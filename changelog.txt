This version is marked beta because some things have changed to the way I register fluids. This could cause worlds to corrupt (though it's meant to prevent it). I'd love to hear feedback, but be careful nevertheless.

-Added shortcuts for the Undo and Redo actions.

-Bugfix: Client crash when working with heat, mentioning FurnaceBehaviour.
-Bugfix: Wrong usage of FluidRegistry.
